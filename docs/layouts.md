# Layouts
* **Blank** : Blank layout is the most simple view of a page: it is a blank view including required Styles and JavaScripts. This is used for the scenarios like: login, landing, register, etc. that is not rendered with additional components (header, footer, etc.)
* **Simple** : Similar to Blank layout,but including only header and footer. This is used for popups, printable version, etc.
* **NoSidebar** : Similar to Simple layout, but including user profile menu. This is used for complex reports which need more space in the browser.
* **Full**: This is the full featured layout including header, footer, profile, and sidebar menu which is mostly used in admin panels.
